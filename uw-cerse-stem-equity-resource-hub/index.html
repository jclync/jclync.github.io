                    supporting equitable student success in STEM.

                            in STEM fields in higher education. Their current research is focusing on the <b>PNW LSAMP (Pacific Northwest

                            From their research, they've observed that

                <h2>Our impact</h2>
                <p> By using UW SERCH, students can find research opportunities, get academic support, and 
                    connect with their peers. Staff are able to foster interpersonal relationships with students, 
                    improving student advising efforts and building community. There is also the opportunity for facilitated 
                    collaboration between efforts from various campus organizations to increase equity in STEM.
                    <br><br>
                    While the development of the STEM resource hub is still in progress, our work was able to <span class=markup>provide 
                    UW CERSE with more insight regarding the types of resources and opportunities that LSAMP students and staff want to see 
                    in a resource hub</span>, as well as <span class=markup>give direction for further iterations of a more-detailed platform </span>
                    by expanding the scope to include the other schools that are part of the PNW LSAMP. Our hope is that the UW SERCH platform 
                    will flourish into a go-to resource for students and staff to find information about the various efforts on campus 
                    that were created to help support their academic success.

                    our team consulted with our sponsor on project direction, in which they recommended staff at the PNW LSAMP centers 
                    for us to connect with so we could get a better understanding on what the LSAMP is. Our team was able to connect directly 
                    with the LSAMP coordinators at UW, where we had the opportunity to visit the UW LSAMP center to get a better sense of
                    what resources exist in the physical space.

                    However, due to limited time, our team was unable to recruit and schedule additional usability 
                    testing for the high-fidelity prototype. Thus, we were unable to get feedback on and further refine our high-fidelity 
                    prototype before handing off to UW CERSE.

                    <p>If we had more time, I would definitely want to test the high-fidelity prototype with further user testing.

                            schools in the PNW LSAMP?

                            <li><b>Communication is key!</b> As the team member in charge of heading communications with UW CERSE, it was imperative that I 
                                handled deadlines and kept our sponsor in loop on our status and roadblocks.
                            <li><b>Flexibility in times of uncertainty.</b> Our team ran into difficulties when recruiting participants for our surveys and interviews.
                                Fortunately, we were able to widen our participant pool through our sponsor and personal connections.
                        </ul>
                        <p>Overall, this 6-month project was an incredibly rewarding learning experience as I had the opportunity to work on an end-to-end 
                            project. It was super cool to look back and see how our project started from a concept idea our sponsor had to 
                            a website prototype after many months of extensive research, analysis, and ideation. Thank you to my amazing
