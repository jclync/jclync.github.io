                For my HCDE Senior Capstone, my team and I partnered with the <b>UW Center for Evaluation & 
                Research for STEM Equity</b>, a research center. The focus of our capstone project was 
                to produce an interactive platform to connect students, staff, and faculty to campus resources 
                supporting equitable student success in STEM.

                    <p class="client-context"> The UW Center for Evaluation & Research for STEM Equity, or UW CERSE, 
                        is a team of researchers who focus on conducting research to improve equity and broaden representation 
                        in STEM fields in higher education. Their current research is focusing on the <b>PNW LSAMP (Pacific Northwest 
                        Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation)</b>, a university program consisting of several universities 
                        and community colleges from Washington, Oregon, and Idaho whose mission is to support underrepresented 
                        students pursuing a bachelor's degree in STEM. <br><br>
                        
                        From their research, they've observed that 
                        <span class="markup"><b>efforts related to improving STEM equity are often siloed, hard to locate, and sometimes 
                        provide gaps</b></span> in the types of support that students need. Our team's task was to learn about where 
                        these gaps occur, and alleviate this issue by creating an interactive STEM resource hub platform.

                    <h2>Our impact</h2>
                    <p> By using UW SERCH, students can find research opportunities, get academic support, and 
                        connect with their peers. Staff are able to foster interpersonal relationships with students, 
                        improving student advising efforts and building community. There is also the opportunity for facilitated 
                        collaboration between efforts from various campus organizations to increase equity in STEM.
                        <br><br>
                        While the development of the STEM resource hub is still in progress, our work was able to <span class=markup>provide 
                        UW CERSE with more insight regarding the types of resources and opportunities that LSAMP students and staff want to see 
                        in a resource hub</span>, as well as <span class=markup>give direction for further iterations of a more-detailed platform </span>
                        by expanding the scope to include the other schools that are part of the PNW LSAMP. Our hope is that the UW SERCH platform 
                        will flourish into a go-to resource for students and staff to find information about the various efforts on campus 
                        that were created to help support their academic success.

                    <h2>Deep diving into our problem space</h2>
                    <p>To familiarize ourself with our project, our team first conducted literature review to <b>explore the domains relevant 
                        to our problem space</b> to <span class=markup>discover who is historically marginalized in STEM</span> and 
                        <span class=markup>understand the roadblocks to finding STEM resources</span>. Prior to beginning our resesarch, 
                        our team consulted with our sponsor on project direction, in which they recommended staff at the PNW LSAMP centers 
                        for us to connect with so we could get a better understanding on what the LSAMP is. Our team was able to connect directly 
                        with the LSAMP coordinators at UW, where we had the opportunity to visit the UW LSAMP center to get a better sense of
                        what resources exist in the physical space.

                <p> After our research and analysis, our team got in discussion with UW CERSE on project alignment. We decided that due to time constraints for the capstone project, 
                    for the next phase of the project (prototyping the resource hub platform), our team would focus solely on the University of Washington. For future implementation 
                    of the resource hub, other schools will be considered.

                <!-- <p>Participants and Recruitment</p>
                <p>Each team member facilitated an in-depth user testing session. We sought to test with the students that would be using this website platform, 
                    so we recruited our pool from those that currently attending the UW, study a STEM major, and identify as a minority individual.
                </p>
                <p>Testing Procedure</p>
                <p> During these testing sessions, participants were asked to complete a series of tasks while thinking out loud:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Search for an organization and message their point of contact</li>
                        <li>Filter and register for an event</li>
                    </ol>

                        - Left bar navigation made it easy to understand the functionality of each tab
                        - Filtering had some bugs but this could be due to the interactivity of the prototype
                        - Some participants had difficulty as we had mapped the path to only work
                        once the filter arrow was closed or opened

                        - The search bar was often the first line of action to find an organization or event
                        - There are many different avenues to do the same thing which could be confusing

                        12
                        - The landing screen could be cluttered since there are many buttons to click
                        - The biggest issue is the clickability and flow of the wireframe, not really the design
                        - Wording of certain buttons, especially in filtering, is not specific enough
                        - Introduce a feature to recommend events and opportunities to other students
                        - Personalization in the opportunities and resources shown would be helpful (i.e.
                        specific internships or events based on their interests or major)

                    <p>based on feedback and recommendations from the testing, we made corresponding updates to the prototype. We also incorporated
                        brand color, images, and detailed-components, added interactivity to the screens to transition to a higher-fidelity prototype. 
                        Due to limited time, our team was unable to recruit and schedule additional usability 
                        testing for the high-fidelity prototype. Thus, we were unable to get feedback on and further refine our high-fidelity 
                        prototype before handing off to UW CERSE.

                <h2>Reflecting and looking to the future</h2>
                <p>Overall, this 6-month project was a significant learning experience as I was able to work on an 
                    end-to-end project. It was rewarding to look back and see how our project started from a paragraph on the project context to 
                    a website prototype after extensive research, analysis, and ideation. 
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li></li>
                    <li>communication is key! As the team member in charge of heading communications with UW CERSE, it was imperative that I 
                        handled deadlines and kept our sponsor in loop on our status and roadblocks.
                    </li>
                    <li>Flexibility in times of uncertainty. Our team ran into difficulties when recruiting participants for our surveys and interviews.
                        Fortunately, we were able to widen our participant pool through our sponsor and personal connections.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>If we had more time, I would definitely want to test the high-fidelity prototype with further user testing. 
                    I would also want to have more input from staff perspective as our project mainly focused on student-view - fleshing
                out the staff user flow would allow more insight on if their needs are being met. Some questions I would explore are:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>How intuitive to users find the filtering?</li>
                    <li>Are there any STEM resources missing?</li>
                    <li>How would further implementation of this project go when broadening the scope to include the other
                        schools in the PNW LSAMP?
                    </li>
                    <li>Can we observe success metrics such as increase in engagement rate of students accessing STEM resources?
                    </li>
                    <li>Are the features and designs feasible to implement from a developer standpoint?</li>
                </ul>
