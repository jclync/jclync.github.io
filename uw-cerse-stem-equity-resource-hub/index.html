                    For my HCDE Senior Capstone, my team and I partnered with <b> UW CERSE (UW Center for Evaluation & Research for STEM Equity)</b>, a research center at the University of Washington, Seattle. The focus of our capstone project was 
                    to produce an interactive platform to connect students, staff, and faculty to campus resources supporting equitable student success in STEM.

                <h2>Connecting staff, students and resources for academic and personal success</h2>
                <p> 
                    By using UW SERCH, students can find research opportunities, get academic support, and connect with their peers. Staff are able to foster interpersonal relationships with students, improving student advising efforts and building community. There is also the opportunity for facilitated collaboration between efforts from various campus organizations to increase equity in STEM.
                    <br><br>
                    While the development of the STEM resource hub is still in progress, our work was able to <span class=markup>provide 
                    UW CERSE with more insight regarding the types of resources and opportunities that LSAMP students and staff want to see 
                    in a resource hub</span>, as well as <span class=markup>give direction for further iterations of a more-detailed platform</span> by expanding the scope to include the other schools that are part of the PNW LSAMP. Our hope is that the UW SERCH platform will flourish into a go-to resource for students and staff to find information about the various efforts on campus that were created to help support their academic success.

                    Using the brainstormed concept ideas, the resource hub website was sketched out first on paper, then wireframed as a low-fidelity prototype. For the full sketches and wireframes, see this <a href="../assets/file-uploads/uw-cerse-wireframes.pdf" target="_blank" class="link underline"><b>document</b></a>.

                    After our research and analysis, our team got in discussion with UW CERSE on project alignment. We decided that going 
                    forwards into the next phase of the project (prototyping the resource hub platform), our team would focus solely on the 
                    University of Washington due to time constraints for the capstone project. For future implementation of the STEM resource hub, other schools will be involved.

                    Based on feedback and recommendations from the testing, corresponding updates were made to the prototype. Brand color, images, detailed-components, and additional interactivity were implemented to transition to a higher-fidelity prototype. 
                    However, due to limited time, our team was unable to recruit and schedule additional usability testing for the high-fidelity prototype. Thus, we were unable to get feedback on and further refine our high-fidelity prototype before handing off to UW CERSE.

                        If we had more time, I would definitely want to test the high-fidelity prototype with further user testing. I would also want to have more input from staff perspective as our project had mainly focused on student-view - fleshing out the staff user flow would allow more insight on if there are any features we missed. Some questions I would want to explore are:

                        <li>How intuitive do users find the filtering?</li>
                        <li>Are there any STEM resources missing?</li>
                        <li>How would further implementation of this project when broadening the scope to include the other schools in the PNW LSAMP?
                        <li>Can we observe success metrics such as increase in engagement rate of students accessing STEM resources?
                        <li>Are the features and designs feasible to implement from a developer standpoint?</li>

                            Overall, this 6-month project was an incredibly rewarding learning experience as I had the opportunity to work on an end-to-end project. It was super cool to look back and see how our project started from a concept idea that our sponsor had to a website prototype after many months of extensive research, analysis, and ideation.
