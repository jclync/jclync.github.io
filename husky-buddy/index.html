                    Husky Buddy emerged from a Human Centered Design & Engineering course project, HCDE318 - Introduction to User-Centered Design, where my team aimed to develop a solution to streamline the formation of online groups and boost student engagement amidst challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic. <br><br>
                    Experiencing the transition to remote learning firsthand, my team and I witnessed the effects of 'Zoom fatigue' and the difficulties of connecting with classmates online. Motivated by these experiences, we chose to address the importance of community-building, recognizing its potential to foster greater student engagement in online learning environments.

                        In early 2020 when Covid first emerged, many higher education institutions in the US cancelled in-person instruction and transitioned to the new era of Zoom University. In a report on a random-sample survey of more than 1,000 students, <span class="markup">65% reported that they had fewer opportunities to collaborate with peers, and 42% said that engagement in course content was an issue</span> (<a href="https://everylearnereverywhere.org/wp-content/uploads/Suddenly-Online_DP_FINAL.pdf" target="_blank" class="link">Means and Neisler, 2020&nearr;</a>). Furthermore, another similar study found that <span class="markup">78% of respondents feel that online classes are unengaging, and 75% miss having interactions with instructors and peers</span> (<a href="https://tophat.com/press-releases/adrift-in-a-pandemic-survey/" target="_blank" class="link">Read, 2020&nearr;</a>).

                <p>
                    To understand our project goals and problem space, we conducted interviews with our target user group (students at UW). Our team conducted three 30-minute semi-structured interviews over Zoom, asking questions to get insight on their experiences with online learning and making connections with classmates and instructors during the pandemic. We then analyzed the responses by grouping responses together in clusters to see if there were any patterns or themes in the experiences of the students.

                <p>Interactivity components were then added to link the wireframed screens together into user flows. These flows then underwent <b>usability testing to gauge the user flow, feasibility, and intuitiveness of our mobile platform design</b>. Our team tested with a total of <b>6 participants</b>, all students attending the UW. Our tests were all conducted over Zoom, where we had one team member facilitate the session while the others took notes.

                        Based on feedback from the usability test sessions, our team began working on transforming our platform from a low-fidelity to a high-fidelity prototype. Brand color, images, detailed, components, and additional interactivity were implemented. <br><br>
                        My team members focused on the profile page and discussion forum for classes, while I focused on group creation and filtering for classmates. Additionally, I designed the Husky Buddy logo that was used for our app. Since the mascot of the University of Washington is an Alaskan Malamute, I incorporated the outline of a paw print into the 'HB' letters of the app logo. Gold and purple are the school colors, which I implemented as colors of the logo.

                    <p>
                        This was my first time collaborating remotely on a team project, which helped me learn skills in navigating group dynamics when it isn't possible for everyone to physically be together.

                        <li>
                            <b>Weekly check-ins are essential.</b> Our project was conducted entirely online due to the pandemic, so our team scheduled weekly dedicated time outside of our regularly scheduled class-time to share progress on our assigned work, discuss challenges, and align on next steps. These check-ins helped our team touch base to offer support, provide feedback, and brainstorm ideas collectively.

                            <b>As a designer, I value having concrete steps.</b> At the end of our team meetings, I would often ask about the next steps for our project. Knowing upcoming deadlines and next steps helped me effectively budget my time, ensuring adequate planning so I could finish my assigned tasks and keep our project on track for completion.

                        <br>If we had more time, I would want to test our high-fidelity prototype to get feedback on the iterations we made based on the usability tests we conducted on the low-fidelity prototype. Since we only focused on students for our project, I would also consider the larger system. Considering different stakeholders (e.g. instructors), it would be interesting to think through how they would utilize this mobile app and get their input on if they have any suggestions for encouraging student participation and engagement.
