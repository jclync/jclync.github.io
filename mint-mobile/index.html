                            Some participants had confusion on the 'Mintfluencer' Campaign and how it was intended to boost follower engagement.

                            Participants noticed that the majority of the feed was consisted of static content such as images and text, resulting in a lack of engagement.

                    Based on feedback from the usability testing, our team began working on adding more content to the feed by fleshing out the Mintfluencers campaign, adding reels and videos, and differentiating ads from regular posts. While my team members worked on the targeted ads, I focused on the Mintfluencers campaign.

                    <p>
                        This was the first time my team and I had worked on an advertising and marketing-focused project. Thus, we had to learn how to adapt our user-centered approach to address business goals effectively as well. I found the creative freedom when designing the posts and reels for this project to be quite liberating, especially with the added humor that our team was able to add in the captions to match Mint's witty brand personality.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Key Takeaways:</h4>
                    <ul class="key-takeaways list">
                        <li>
                            <b>Business Goals are crucial.</b> Given the marketing focus of our project, our team needed to consider the needs of our users (Mint customers, non-customers, and Ryan's fans), while also balancing these with Mint's business objectives. This included increasing their social media engagement and achieving their overall business goals.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Studying existing successes provided valuable inspiration.</b> Despite having little marketing experience, analyzing successful competitors like T-Mobile helped me learn what trends are effective on Instagram. This allowed our team to utilize successful strategies to grow Mint's following and social media engagement.
                        </li>

                        <br>If we had more time, I would have wanted to get input from Mint Mobile customers and IG followers before handoff to Mint Mobile. Due to time constraints for the project, our usability testing pool was limited to participants we could easily recruit, such as classmates and friends. Considering the rising trend of social media, it would be interesting to incorporate additional pop culture references in future iterations of this project. This could include using trending audio, memes, and references to film and TV.
